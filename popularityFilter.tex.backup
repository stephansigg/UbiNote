In this paper we describe the formatting requirements for
SIGCHI Conference Proceedings, and this sample file
offers recommendations on writing for the worldwide
SIGCHI readership. Please review this document even if
you have submitted to SIGCHI conferences before, some
format details have changed relative to previous years.

\section{Introduction}

% 1000 ??? apps but which is the really good one?
% -- paula: Find the app that I want for my category
% -- me: From these, identify the flops and topps.
% 
% -- Also: Identify the real popular apps and trends not from absolute usage but relative usage 
% -- And: Be among the first to identify a trend and jump off before it is over.

With continuing popularity of current smartphone operating systems, the number of available apps in the respective app stores continues to grow rapidly.
The google play store currently features more than 1.4 million apps and Apple's IOS app store more than 1.3 million apps. 
Follow-ups are the windows playstore ($>$300.000), Amazon appstore ($>240.000$) and BlackBerry world ($>130.000$)\footnote{http://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/}.

It has become easy to find an app for virtually any possible category but challenging to identify good and reliable apps from this overwhelming assortment. 
Ofthen, this tedious process might involve installing multiple apps and testing each of them individually. 
Of course, users are usually supported by a recommendation system in which apps can be rated on.
While useful, this system favours apps with a bigger crowd of users such as corporation-developed apps or older and therefore better known apps.
For instance, an app which is popular and frequently used in a small community of users might have low chance to be discovered by a greater public due to fewer ratings. 
Clearly, absolute user number wins over relative high satisfaction of a smaller crowd of app-users.
Paradoxically, offensively annoy users to submit a rrewith requests to submit a recommendation is a better strategy to rate them stand a better chance to receive high recommendations than 


\section{Overview}

Description of the system (schematic view)
\begin{itemize}
 \item normalize
 \item shift and interpolate
 \item cluster (k-means + features)
 \item Consensus
 \item Alignment (see ISWC note)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Normalisation of Timeseries to make them comparable}
normalise, shift, interpolate
\subsection{Clustering timeseries}
k-means and features
\subsection{Compute consensus timeseries}
explain the approach
\subsection{Alignment to find trend-state}
explain alignment method

\section{Paulas method}

\section{results}
\begin{itemize}
\item top 102 apps
\item 4 clusters
\item show the four clusters (timeseries)
\item and also show the consensus TS for each
\end{itemize}

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you

% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
